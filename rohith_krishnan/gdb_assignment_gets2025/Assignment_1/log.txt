Issues found

1. The issue was that the frequency counting code works by counting adjacent elements of the vector and then calculating its frequency.
If it differs from the next adjacent element, in that case the frequency would be reset and again started from the adjacent element.
But this function , ie the frequency counting lines of code expects the array to be sorted , but in our case although we are the sorting the array we are sorting it from 
index 1 not from index 0 so first element position wont change even if there are other similar elements in the array 
because after sorting all the similar elements will be together except the first one. So that is the bug which was preventing the code to display the expected output.
ie, instead of this    sort(v1.begin() + 1, v1.end()) it should be   sort(v1.begin(), v1.end())

2. after the frequency counting code is executed , it is then stored in a 2D vector with element and its count as  a
pair , then we are sorting them based on frequency but in this case also we are starting from index 1 instead of zero. So that also we have to change.ie  instead of this 
sort(v2.begin()+1, v2.end(),  comparecount) it should be     sort(v2.begin(), v2.end(),  comparecount)'
