### C++ Assignments

- **_Ayushmaan Das (I000452)_**

- Every Assignment has the following folder structure:

```
├── Assignment_Number/
│   ├── Assignment_Number.cpp       (Actual Question)
│   ├── Assignment_Number.exe
│   └── Solution.cpp                (Proposed solution after Debugging)
│   └── Solution.exe
│   └── gdb.txt                     (The GDB Log File)
```

- Also, the solution explanation for every assignment is mentioned as a comment in the
  top of every `Solution.cpp` file. Example:

```cpp
/*ISSUES SPOTTED IN THE CODE:
- Line 32 dfs().....remaining solution
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

rest of the code
```

- Correction in the code can be found with comment `//CORRECTION MADE HERE`.
